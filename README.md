## Description 

Paper Abstract:

```
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the disparities in vaccine access for low-income
African countries. The African Union launched an initiative in 2021 to develop vaccine man-
ufacturing capacity in Africa to meet 60% of the continent’s demand by 2040. Despite Africa
being the largest vaccine market by volume, it produces less than 1% of its demand. Around
80% of vaccines acquired for Africa are funded with financial assistance, primarily from Gavi.
Gavi and UNICEF have established an affordable vaccine market for low-income countries
through economies of scale, pooled procurement, coordinated tenders, and innovative finan-
cial mechanisms. This study assesses the impact of varying African vaccine manufacturing
capacities on the UNICEF/Gavi market. It investigates the strategic decisions of profit-driven
manufacturers, who must determine how to meet Gavi vaccine demand with production from
inside and outside the African region. The study employs Monte Carlo simulation to analyze
a two-stage stochastic optimization model in which manufacturers decide production levels
within and outside Africa. Our findings show that achieving the African Union’s 2040 target
and encouraging manufacturers to uphold their production capacity for eight vaccines would
result in an additional cost of between 2.7% and 11.9% of the annual UNICEF/Gavi vaccine
procurement budget.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
